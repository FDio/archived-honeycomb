= Honeycomb {project-version} Release notes

Release notes for honeycomb {project-version}.

Honeycomb is a generic management agent and provides a framework
for building specialized agents. Exposes NETCONF, RESTCONF and BGP as northbound interfaces.

It uses many features and utilities from different http://www.opendaylight.org/[Opendaylight (ODL)] projects
(e.g. yangtools, controller, mdsal, netconf, bgpcep).

The biggest use case of honeycomb is VPP (fd.io's Vector packet processor).
Honeycomb delivers a management agent to enable integration of VPP with e.g. SDN controllers such as Opendaylight.

For VPP specific distribution of Honeycomb, please refer to https://wiki.fd.io/view/Hc2vpp[hc2vpp] project.
